          land, Thi Lo Su towers 300 meters high
          and spans across 500 meters of naturally
          carved limestone ridge in the Mae Klong River. Tu
          cked away in the remote Um Phang Wildlife Sanctuary of Tak

          ing the dry season of January to April, when the eroded roc
          k formations emerge from receding water levels. The area is
          rife with superstition influenced by local legends, includi
          ng the respect given to its signature dog head-shaped ston
          e that has inspired many myths related to the canyon’s development.</p>

        <p>A jungle reserve deep in Southern Thailand, Khao Sok
          National Park is said to be the oldest evergreen
          rainforest in the world, with some sources claiming
          it offers comparable biodiversity to the Amazon rainforest
          and you can visit with Culture Trip as part of our
          10-day small-group Southern Thailand trip. Its central
          lake spans a 185-square kilometer area, home to
          a huge variety of wildlife from elephants and
          tigers to hornbills and pythons.</p>

        <p class="sec-cap"> for a slice of paradise </p>

        <p>Also known as Buffalo Bay, this quiet seascape is
          one of the most unique and untouched beaches in Thailand,
          curving delicately to enclose mangrove forests and the calm
          tides that spill out into the unrivaled beauty of the Andaman Sea
          . The beach is one of two on tiny Koh Phayam Island, itself
          one of Thailand’s best-kept-secrets, offering weary
          island-hoppers reprise from all-night beach parties
          and parking lots of taxi boats ubiquitous to more name
          brand destinations.</p>

        <p>Ko Hong is certainly one of the most beautiful
          islands in the Krabi area. Unfortunately its natural
          beauty and closeness to Ao Nang, generates an endless
          stream of longtail boats that unload thousands of tourists
          onto its shores. The only way to enjoy the spectacular
          beach is to organize your own trip and get there by 8am,
          then you will have a couple of hours of its unspoiled beauty to enjoy.</p>

        <p>Just a short longtail journey from its more

          is a gorgeous, self-sustainable group of three
          teardrops of land connected by a ribbon of beach.
          The islands themselves are carved out of ancient volcanic rock,
          tapering off into three distinct bays packed with marine
          life and incredible biodiversity of coral species
          for world-class snorkeling and scuba diving.</p>
